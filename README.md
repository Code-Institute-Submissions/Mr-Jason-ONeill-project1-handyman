# Project1-Handyman
Only using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decided to build a website that will advertise side jobs that I can do in my spare time.
Index page - nav bar containing 'About Me', 'Contact', 'List of Jobs'(Possibly add a drop down list that will take user to sub-sections)

About Me - History about myself, experience, goals.

Contact - Address, Phone number, email address, text area for quick enquiries (submit button will not work as it is just HTML/CSS & Bootstrap project)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------UI
(Each page will contain same Header & Footer)
Header/Navbar - #H1: Logo 

##H2, ul, li-Home, li-About, li-Contact
Footer - ##H5, ul, li-i class x3 - font awesome icons - socials 












-------------------------------------------------------------Bugs & Fixes

Hamburger menu button - not working on small screens.
